        The arguments to this function are always coerced into two

        four strings.

        Args, two datetimes:
            start_date: A datetime object representing the start of the range.
            end_date: A datetime object representing the end of the range.

        Args, four strings:
            start_month: A string matching strftime's "%B" specificer for
                what will eventually become start_date.
            start_day: A string containing a positive integer between 1 and
                the maximum number of days in the previously specified month.
            end_month: A string matching strftime's "%B" specificer for
                what will eventually become end_date.
            end_day: A string containing a positive integer between 1 and the
                maximum number of days in the previously specified month.

        In the former case, exact years and times are used.

        In the latter case:
            - The year is assumed to be "this year" unless the end month/day
              happen to occur before the start.
            - The time of the start day is assumed to be midnight.

              midnight of the following day.
