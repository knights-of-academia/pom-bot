# Pom Wars Setup

A Pom War is an event held among multiple Discord guilds where each guild can
choose to have members of only a specific team or multiple teams.

To get a guild ready for the event, decide which is right for your guild.

## Single-team guilds

- Add the bot to the guild
- Make a role called either "Knight" or "Viking"
- Make a channel called "#the-draft"
- Make a channel where ! actions will be put (#battlegrounds)
  - Set permissions so that only players with the chosen role can see this
    channel
- Give Debashis the guild ID
- Give Debashis the exact name of the channel created

## Any-team guilds

- Add the bot to the guild
- Make two roles called "Knight" and "Viking"
- Make a channel called "#the-draft"
- Make a channel where ! actions will be put for each Role (eg. #knights,
  #vikings)
  - Set permissions so that only players with the role for each channel can
    see that channel and not the other
- Give Debashis the exact name of both channels created

## Addition steps for configure before and after a beta

For beta

- Make #the-draft invisible to everybody except the beta testers

For "live":

- Remove the restrictions on the #the-draft channel
