# Pom Bot
The default pom bot with simple features, based on the work of @moesgaarda found here: https://github.com/Moesgaarda/python-pom-bot

## Changes to original software
The original version of the software used MongoDB, this fork makes use of MySQL instead.

## Installation

1. Python 3.6 or newer.

2. The Python dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).

3. MySQL database running on the default port (3306/tcp).

After this has been set up, it should be plug and play! Enjoy!
